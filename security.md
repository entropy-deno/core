# Security Policy

## Version support

Each major version of Entropy is supported for couple of months.

Our policy is to provide major versions with as few breaking changes as
possible, so you do not need to worry about LTS support or minor-version-only
bugfixes. Just upgrade the framework regularly and enjoy!

Alpha and beta versions are released independently and are intended for testing
purposes, so we do not provide any additional support for them as they are
unstable and may contain breaking changes.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you have discovered any security vulnerability in Entropy, please report it
directly to [me](https://github.com/dominiq007) privately. **Do not create a
GitHub issue for any security vulnerabilities!**
