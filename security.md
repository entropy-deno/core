# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Entropy has a regular release cycle - major versions are released every three months.
Each major version is supported for couple of months.

Our policy though is to provide major versions with as few breaking changes as it is possible,
so you do not need to worry about LTS support or minor-version-only bugfixes. Just upgrade the framework and enjoy!

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0         | :white_check_mark: |

Alpha and beta versions are released independently and are intended for testing purposes,
so we do not grant additional support for them as they may contain breaking changes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered any security vulnerability in Entropy,
please report it to [me](https://github.com/dominiq007) privately.
