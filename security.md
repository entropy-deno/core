# Security Policy

**PLEASE DO NOT PUBLISH SECURITY ISSUES PUBLICLY:
[SEE BELOW](#reporting-a-vulnerability).**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered any security vulnerability in Entropy, please
[report it](https://github.com/dominiq007) privately.

**Do not create a GitHub issue for any security vulnerabilities!**

## Version Support

Entropy aligns with release [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). It does
not have a fixed release cycle â€“ new major versions are usually released every
few months.

Our policy is to provide major versions with as few breaking changes as
possible, so you do not need to worry about LTS support or minor-version-only
bugfixes.

- **Patch** releases are released as needed and contain only bug fixes
- **Minor** versions contain new features and fixes
- **Major** releases contain breaking API changes and new features
- **Alpha** and **beta** versions are released independently and are intended
  for testing purposes
